# ArduinoMemoryGame

## Description
A memory game built with an Arduino. The game is composed of two LEDs and two buttons. Based off which LED lights up, the person playing the game is meant to hit the respective button. With every sucessful guess the game will continue to ramp up the
difficulty by having more LEDs light up.

## Purpose
The project was made with the intention of understanding a bit more about electronic components, about how the Arduino works, as well as getting familiar with sketches.

## Components
2x Green LEDs
2x Push Button Switches
2x 220 OHM Resistors
2X 10 KILOHM Resistors
